<h1>Programming Experience 2016 (PX/16) Workshop</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Imagine a software development task. Some sort of requirements and specification including performance goals and perhaps a platform and programming language. A group of developers head into a vast workroom. &lt;crossfade to developers exiting the vast workroom&gt; The Programming Experience Workshop is about what happens in that room when one or a couple of programmers sit down in front of computers and produce code. Do they create text that is transformed into running behavior (the old way), or do they operate on behavior directly ("liveness"); are they exploring live domains to understand the true nature of the requirements; are they like authors creating new worlds; does visualization matter; is the experience immediate, immersive, vivid and continuous; do fluency, literacy, and learning matter; do they build tools, meta-tools; are they creating languages to express new concepts quickly and easily; and curiously, is joy relevant to the experience? Correctness, performance, standard tools, foundations, and text-as-program are important traditional research areas, but the experience of programming and how to improve and evolve it are the focus of this workshop.</p>

<h2>Call for Participation</h2>

<p>Submissions are solicited for Programming Experience 2016 (PX/16). The thrust of the workshop is to explore the human experience of programming&mdash;what it feels like to program, or more accurately, what should it feel like. The technical topics include exploratory programming, live programming, authoring, representation of active content, visualization, navigation, modularity mechanisms, immediacy, literacy, fluency, learning, tool building, and language engineering. Submissions can be in any form and format, including but not limited to papers, presentations, demos, videos, panels, debates, essays, writers' workshops, and art. "Presentation" slots will be between 30 minutes and one hour, depending on quality, form, and relevance to the workshop. Submissions directed toward publication should be so marked, and the program committee will engage in peer review for all such papers. Video publication will be arranged.</p>

<h2>Duration</h2>

<p>One or (preferably) two days</p>

<h2>Format</h2>

<p>Paper presentations, presentations without papers, live demonstrations, performances, videos, panel discussions, debates, writers' workshops, art galleries, dramatic readings.</p>

<h2>Review</h2>

<p>Submissions labeled as publications will undergo standard peer review; other submissions will be reviewed for relevance and quality; shepherding will be available.</p>

<h2> Important dates </h2>

<p> TBA </p>

<h2> Publication </h2>

<p>ECOOP workshop standard for papers and essays; video publication on Vimeo or other streaming site; other publication on the PX workshop website.</p>
